# PfSense Lab

## Objective
This PfSense Lab explores the configuration and integration of PfSense, an open source routing and firewall, on any system. The goal of this lab is to analyze, assess, and test the security effectiveness of PfSense in preventing and responding to various cyber threats against different Linux and Windows systems. I am also learning about various networking concepts and how to manage them, such as DHCP. Furthermore, this lab allows me to learn about firewalls and how to configure said firewall rules so it protects user systems against cyber attacks and prevent unwanted access into crucial systems.

### Skills Learned
- Understadning how to configure PfSense to provide real-time protection
- Configuring and managing DHCP servers and DNS forwarders/resolvers
- Setting up and doing an initial configuration of PfSense
- Creating inbound and outbound firewall rules to control network traffic and network intrusion
- Responding to security alerts and taking the appropriate action to handle them

### Tools Used
- VirtualBox as a way to virtualize the PfSense server
- PfSense as a network security tool
